# 💰 CV STANDARDIZER v2.0 - CLIENT DEMO SCRIPT

## 🎤 The Hook
"We all know the pain: You get a great candidate but their CV is a mess. It doesn't follow your company branding, and manually reformatting it takes 30 minutes. What if you could do it in 5 seconds?"

## 🚶 Step 1: The Template "Teaching" (Visual Style Cloning)
"First, we teach the system your brand. No coding required. Take any DOCX you already like—for example, this premium **AM0275 Corporate Template**."

1. **Upload Template**: Click 'Upload New Template'.
2. **Auto-Detection**: "Watch as the AI automatically identifies 'Work Experience', 'Skills', and 'Profile Summary' sections. It builds a digital map of your branding instantly."
3. **Skeleton Creation**: "The system creates a 'Clean Skeleton' where we stripped the old data but kept the fonts, margins, and tables perfectly intact."

## 🚶 Step 2: The "Magic" Extraction
"Now, we take the candidate's messy PDF. It might have weird bullets, tables, or non-standard headers."

1. **Upload Candidate CV**: (Choose `Vineetha Thamban.pdf`).
2. **Live Shredding**: "The 'Shredder' engine goes to work. It doesn't just copy text; it understands roles, dates, and technology stacks. It even cleans '8+ years' from headers and fixes broken bullets."

## 🚶 Step 3: The Reconstruction
"Finally, we choose our branding. Want it as a **Corporate Dev** style? Or a **Service Company** grid? Maybe the **Mirrored Dual-Column** layout for high-end clients?"

1. **Select Template**: (Pick `My_Template` or `Corp_Dev`).
2. **One-Click Reformat**: Click 'Process to Template'.
3. **Instant Download**: "There it is. A perfectly branded, corporate-ready DOCX. Ready for the client's inbox."

## 💎 The Value Pitch
- **30 mins -> 5 seconds**: Huge productivity gain for recruiters.
- **Consistent Branding**: Every candidate looks like they belong to your firm.
- **Universal Mapper**: Works with ANY Word document. Tables, columns, mirrored layouts—solved.
