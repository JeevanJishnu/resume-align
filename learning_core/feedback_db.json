        "analysis": "The candidate, JERIN JACOB, has a strong background as a Travel Consultant with over 5 years of experience using GDS platforms like Amadeus, Sabre, and Galileo. They have experience in ticketing, itinerary planning, and corporate travel coordination. However, the job description is for an 'Amadeus GDS Integration Consultant' which requires hands-on experience integrating with Amadeus Enterprise APIs (SOAP/XML), understanding of WSDLs/XSDs, GDS message architecture, and providing technical guidance to backend/architecture teams for certification. The current CV demonstrates usage of Amadeus as an end-user, but lacks evidence of the required technical integration expertise, specific API knowledge, and consulting experience for development teams. To achieve a 100% target score, significant rephrasing and addition of highly technical integration-specific content and responsibilities are required.",
